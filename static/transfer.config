## CHANGING FILES TO BACKUP
# This defines the files to copy to the target directory
# All files in the source directory matching these types will be copied
# To copy an additional file, add it to the list.
# Specfic files can be added using the full file name.
#
# NOTE: fastqs aren't included here, as they have a separate option (above)
# DEV: .bam and .bai have been removed so they can be sent to the temporary BAM store

## HOW TO ADD OR MODIFY PANELS
# Each new panel *must* be added to the panels list in the [panels] section.
# This list is comma delimited, and you can use spaces within the name (as below)
#
# Then, a section for the panel must be created - e.g. [panel name]
# where the panel name must be *exactly* as it is in the [panels] section list.
# This will allow the program to look up the formatting data for the final Excel spreadsheet.
# The column and row values indicate where the panel title should be placed. The rest of the data
# will then be inserted below this, so remember to account for the number of genes if you want
# to place one under another panel.
# These are offsets from cell A1, which would be 0,0. So to select cell C5 you would use column=2, row=4.
# The genes must match the names of the genes in the bed file, which should all follow the format GENE_exon
# The list here only needs the gene name, so it can summarise all exons.
# To summarise a single exon it would need to be added to the bed file separately, as with the hotspot regions
# Where the gene name has been made longer to avoid combining with data for the rest of the gene.
