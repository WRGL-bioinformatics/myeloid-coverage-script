# LRM update TODO

* Find where the input directory is defined - user selected and command line
  * Ensure that this can work under LRM folder structure
  * If not, follow the C# pipeline method of reorganising LRM to match the older structure
  * Prefer not to need to read samplesheets, etc. to identify an LRM-style run.
* Update so that LRM style runs are copied to the Z: as with older runs
* Extract the LRM .vcf.gz files to standard vcf
* Try and find why the coverage generation might be freezing - or add some logs in order to identify *where* the freeze happens.
